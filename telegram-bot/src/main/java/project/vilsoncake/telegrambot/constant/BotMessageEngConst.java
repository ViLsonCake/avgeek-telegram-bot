            Hello dear user. Welcome to *Avgeek bot*!
                        
            *What can this bot do?*
            
            ‚úÖ Send scheduled flights of *wide-body aircraft* to the airport of your choice so you can photograph them properly.
            
            ‚úÖ Notify you about the flight of *An-124*, which in itself is quite rare, but also the bot will notify you separately if the An-124 decides to stop by your airport. And to make sure you don't miss it, you can add your email.
            
            ‚úÖ You can change the mode of the bot, for example, to select notifications only about scheduled flights of wide-body airliners, or only about An-124s.
            
            ‚úÖ The bot supports 3 languages: English, Ukrainian and Russian.
            
            Open the *command menu* for more details.
            
            
            *Now select the airport you're interested in*
            
            For this, write the *icao/iata* code of your airport.
            For example: *(FRA) - Frankfurt Airport*.
